Since the dumbasses at team abnomrals don't know how to write a fucking description of their mods, personality adds a sit (Default Key: Z, Customizable) and a crawl (Default Key: C, Customizable) keybind to the game. Their repo has a climbing feature and I personally thought it was ass so i removed it. Required mods: Blueprint (For this repo, use blueprint-1.19-6.07.jar)
